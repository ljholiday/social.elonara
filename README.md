- **Web Server**: Apache with mod_rewrite
- **Security**: Built-in CSRF protection, input sanitization, secure sessions

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ljholiday/social_elonara.git
   cd social_elonara
   ```

2. **Create database**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE social_elonara;"
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp config/database.php.sample config/database.php
   ```
   - Edit `.env` with your app name, domain, asset path, and SMTP settings.
   - Update `config/database.php` only if you prefer hard-coded credentials; by default it reads from the environment values.

   Mail defaults are defined in `.env`. Typical values:

   ```ini
   MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
   MAIL_PORT=1025
   MAIL_AUTH=false
   MAIL_USERNAME=
   MAIL_PASSWORD=
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=no-reply@elonara.local
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="Elonara Social"
   MAIL_REPLY_TO_ADDRESS=support@elonara.local
   MAIL_REPLY_TO_NAME="Elonara Social Support"
   ```

   For production, see `.env.production.example` and adjust host/credentials accordingly.

4. **Run installation**
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```
5. Create your first member account. 

6. **Promote an initial admin user**
   ```bash
   php scripts/promote-admin.php your@email.com
   ```
   Replace the email with the account you created during registration. This assigns the `super_admin` role so you can access the admin dashboard.

7. **Configure web server** (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details)

### Requirements

## Development

### Coding Standards

This project follows strict coding standards defined in the `dev/` directory:

- **Language Separation**: PHP for logic, HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JS for behavior
- **Security First**: All input validated, output escaped, CSRF protection
- **Modern PHP**: PHP 8.1+ features, strict typing, PSR-12 compliance
- **Semantic CSS**: `.app-` prefixed classes, BEM methodology where appropriate

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Follow the coding standards in `dev/`
4. Make your changes
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Development Setup

The project includes development standards and guidelines in the `dev/` directory:
- `code.xml` - General code organization principles
- `php.xml` - PHP-specific standards and security practices
- `css.xml` - CSS naming conventions and structure
- `database.xml` - Database design and query standards
- `security.xml` - Application security guidelines
- `config/app.php` - Centralized metadata/config consumed via `app_config()` (populated from `.env`)

## Security

Elonara Social takes security seriously:

- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated and sanitized
- **Output Escaping**: All dynamic content is properly escaped
- **CSRF Protection**: Forms include CSRF tokens
- **Secure Sessions**: HTTP-only, secure session cookies
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: PDO prepared statements
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with secure defaults
- **Email Verification**: New accounts stay pending until the member confirms their inbox

## Upcoming Work

- https://github.com/users/ljholiday/projects/17

## Monitoring

- A lightweight checker is available at `scripts/health-check.sh`. It hits `/health`, parses the JSON, and exits non-zero if degraded. Cron example (every 5 minutes, default URL `https://social.elonara.com/health`):
  ```
  */5 * * * * HEALTH_URL=https://social.elonara.com/health /usr/bin/env bash /path/to/social.elonara/scripts/health-check.sh
  ```
  Cron will email output to the server account on failures; adjust `MAILTO` in crontab if needed.

## Acknowledgments

Elonara Social was built to foster real-world connections and community building in an increasingly digital world. It draws inspiration from the simple pleasure of gathering around a table to share food, stories, and experiences.
